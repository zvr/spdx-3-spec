This is a follow on from ISO/IEC 5962:2021 Information technology \u2014 SPDX\u00ae Specification V2.2.1 , and includes new fields. Earlier editions were published by the SPDX workgroup via the Linux Foundation. The SPDX Specification was subsequently transposed into the Joint Development Foundation. [Those earlier editions are: 1.0 (August 2011), 1.1 (August 2012), 1.2 (October 2013), 2.0 (May 2015), 2.1 (November 2016), and 2.2 (May 2020).] Differences between this edition and earlier ones are reported in Annex J ; see also [1] . 4.2 Obsolete features Over the life of a standard, some older approaches can become obsolete and are dropped from subsequent editions, possibly with a replacement approach being provided. Such action involves deprecating those outdated features. This edition identifies all currently deprecated features. No features present in 2.2.1 have been deprecated in this 2.3 release. 4.3 Alternate notation for some conformance requirements This standard contains more than a few cardinality assertions , each of which indicates absolute, optional, or conditional requirements. Here are some examples: Cardinality: Mandatory, one. Cardinality: Optional, one or many. Cardinality: Mandatory, one if {condition} is true or {feature} omitted, zero (shall be omitted) if {condition} is false. Cardinality: 0..1 Cardinality: 0..* Cardinality: 1..1 Cardinality: 1..* Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also, whether a feature is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this document. 4.4 Standard data format requirements The data format specification and recommendations are subject to the following constraints: Shall be in a human readable form. Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool). The SPDX document character set shall support UTF-8 encoding. Multiple serialization formats may be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include: YAML 1.2 see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) see: ECMA-404 The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory Resource Description Framework (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/ tag:value flat text file as described in this specification .xls spreadsheets In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification in the next release: Extensible Markup Language (XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format. Tags and format properties are case sensitive. Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is: Format Extension tag:value *.spdx RDF *.spdx.rdf JSON *.spdx.json XML *.spdx.xml YAML *.spdx.yaml or *.spdx.yml The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) should be present. 4.5 Trademark Compliance To be designated an SPDX document, a file shall comply with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page ).

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = <short form license identifier in Annex A.1> license-exception-id = <short form license exception identifier in Annex A.2> license-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref compound-expression = (simple-expression / simple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id / compound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression / compound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = (simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern-day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be white space between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be white space on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be white space and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . In the tag:value format, a license expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. D.2 Case sensitivity License expression operators ( AND , OR and WITH ) should be matched in a case-sensitive manner. License identifiers (including license exception identifiers) used in SPDX documents or source code files should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, MIT , Mit and mIt should all be treated as the same identifier and referring to the same license. However, please be aware that it is often important to match with the case of the canonical identifier on the SPDX License List . This is because the canonical identifier's case is used in the URL of the license's or exception's entry on the List, and because the canonical identifier is translated to a URI in RDF documents. D.3 Simple license expressions A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: CDDL-1.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: CDDL-1.0+ An SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 D.4 Composite license expressions D.4.1 Introduction More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, may optionally be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in D.4.5 . D.4.2 Disjunctive \"OR\" operator If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT The \"OR\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT OR LGPL-2.1-only An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause D.4.3 Conjunctive \"AND\" operator If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT The \"AND\" operator is commutative, meaning that the above expression should be considered equivalent to: MIT AND LGPL-2.1-only An example where all three different licenses apply would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause D.4.4 Exception \"WITH\" operator Sometimes a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special exception situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <license-exception-id> that represents the special exception terms. For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 The current set of valid exceptions can be found in Annex A.2 . For the most up to date set of exceptions please see spdx.org/licenses . If the applicable exception is not found on the SPDX License Exception List, then use a single <license-ref> to represent the entire license terms (including the exception). D.4.5 Order of precedence and parentheses The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. D.4.6 License expressions in RDF A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required. <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only\"/> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about =\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

That mechanism is intentionally very easy for software tools to identify and detect, since it includes a standard text string that is unlikely to occur in other contexts, and since it uses license identifiers from the SPDX License List or from user-defined LicenseRef- statements. The SPDX specification defines various other fields in the File Information section (Clause 8 ) that are also useful for conveying information on a file-by-file basis, as well as snippet-level information in Snippet Information section (Clause 9 ). For example, the REUSE Software guidelines community expressed interest in having a similar method to recommend that developers use to express their copyright notices in a machine-readable manner. This appendix describes a mechanism, similar to SPDX-License-Identifier , for developers to convey such other file-based and snippet-based information easily in comments in their files. This in turn enables software tools to easily find and extract that information, and to insert it into the corresponding fields of an SPDX document generated by those tools. H.2 File tags format An SPDX file tag consists of a single line, generally as part of a comment near the top of the file, in the following format: SPDX-tagname: <value> where tagname is replaced by the 'tag' defined for tag-value SPDX documents for that field, according to the File Information section of the SPDX specification. The meaning and semantics of any SPDX file tag are intended to be identical to those described in the File Information (Clause 8 ) section of the SPDX specification. Examples: File type (see 8.3 ): SPDX-FileType: SOURCE SPDX-FileType: DOCUMENTATION SPDX-FileType: TEXT Copyright text (see 8.8 ): SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2019 Jane Doe <jane@example.com> SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright 2008-2010 John Smith SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright Example Company SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright contributors to the Foo project. File contributors (see 8.14 ): SPDX-FileContributor: Modified by Jane Doe SPDX-FileContributor: The Regents of the University of California SPDX file tags of a particular type may appear one or multiple times in a file, depending on the corresponding cardinality defined for that field in the File Information section of the SPDX specification. Multiple-line values are not recommended, because doing so will make it harder for simple search tools to extract all data by looking only for lines beginning with the relevant tag. Version 3.0 of the REUSE Software guidelines implements this format, via a recommendation to use the tag SPDX-FileCopyrightText: to include copyright notices as part of a file's comment headers. H.3 Snippet tags format If certain SPDX tags are to apply only to a certain snippet instead of the whole file, SPDX snippet tags should be used. SPDX snippet tags should start with SPDX-SnippetBegin to mark the beginning of the snippet and end with SPDX-SnippetEnd to mark its end, in the following format: SPDX-SnippetBegin SPDX-tagname: <value> ... SPDX-SnippetEnd where tagname is replaced by the 'tag' defined for tag-value SPDX documents for that field, according to the Snippet Information section of the SPDX specification, and ... represents the code snippet itself. The meaning and semantics of any SPDX snippet tag are intended to be identical to those described in the Snippet Information (Clause 9 ) section of the SPDX specification. Any Snippet Information (Clause 9 ) and short-form license identifiers (Annex E ) tags found between begin and end tags mentioned above apply only to such snippet. Snippets may nest, and this is denoted by having SPDX-SnippetBegin / SPDX-SnippetEnd pairs within other pairs, in the same way that parentheses nest in mathematical expressions. In the case of nested snippets, the SPDX file tags are considered to apply to the inner-most snippet.

SPDX document creators should determine for themselves the extent to which they will rely upon the information specified in a file tag. Not all fields in the File Information section will be useful or relevant to use as file tags. For example, SPDX-FileName is unnecessary as it can be easily derived from the actual file name; SPDX-SPDXID is likely to be ignored by an SPDX document creator who may need to define their own SPDXRef- ID system for their document; etc. Another more complex example are SPDX-SnippetBegin and SPDX-SnippetEnd where the line number these two tags are found in could be stored to start and end the range in SnippetLineRange (see 9.4 ).

Use the ExternalRefs SECURITY category and advisory referenceType to report on vulnerabilities related to the components contained in a software product\u2019s SBOM. This enables a software producer to articulate to software consumers the status of vulnerabilities contained in the software product, by means of reporting vulnerability information at either the SBOM document or component level. Providing a link to such data at the time the SBOM is published provides a pointer for where to find this relevant vulnerability information without promulgating vulnerability information inside the SBOM. This is advantageous because the vulnerability information has a short shelf-life (it will change frequently) while the SBOM component data isn\u2019t likely to change if the software has not changed. \"externalRefs\" : [ { \"referenceCategory\" : \"SECURITY\", \"referenceLocator\" : \"https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/blob/master/SBOM_and_VDRbaseline/sag-pm-118_VDR.json\", \"referenceType\" : \"advisory\" } ] K.2 Satisfying NTIA Minimum Elements for an SBOM using SPDX K.2.1 US Executive Order 14028 Minimum Elements for an SBOM US Executive Order 14028 in conjunction with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) outlined minimum elements for an SBOM. The minimum elements are detailed in NTIA's Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software Bill of Maternials and The Minimum Elements for a SBOM documents and summarized below: SBOM Minimum Field Description Author Name Author of the SBOM entry (this may not always be the supplier). Supplier Name Name or identity of the supplier of the component in the SBOM entry. Component Name Designation assigned to a unit of software defined by the original supplier. Version String Version used to identify a component. Component Hash A cryptographic hash to uniquely identify a component. Unique Identifier A unique identifier to help identify components or serve as a look-up key for relevant databases. Relationship Characterizing the relationship that an upstream component X is included in software Y. Timestamp Record of the date and time of the SBOM data assembly. K.2.2 Mapping NTIA Minimum Elements to SPDX Fields The SPDX Specification contains fields able to address each of the NTIA minimum required data fields. NTIA SBOM Minimum Field Satisfying SPDX field Author Name (6.8) Creator Supplier Name (7.5) Package Supplier Component Name (7.1) Package Name Version String (7.3) Package Version Component Hash (7.10) Package Checksum Unique Identifier (7.2) Package SPDX Identifier (6.5) SPDX Document Namespace Relationship (11.1) Relationship: CONTAINS , DESCRIBES The document must DESCRIBES at least one package. Timestamp (6.9) Created K.3 Verifying SPDX Packages Several use cases for SPDX depend on the consumer being able to verify the provenance and integrity of their software. SPDX can support several different scenarios depending on what information is available to the producer, what information is available to the consumer, and how the SPDX document is delivered. These scenarios are described below along with recommended approaches to verifying the SPDX packages. K.3.1 General Guidance If a Package can be represented as a single blob of bytes, such as a tar archive: * PackageChecksum must be computed by applying one of the supported hashing algorithms to the package blob. * PackageDownloadLocation should be a download locator that retrieves the package blob. * A supplier can define a PackageChecksum in a Package without providing a PackageDownloadLocation . This lets consumers perform an offline verification of private blobs. If a Package represents an artifact that logically binds a number of single files together (such as a zip file or a directory): * If the files bound by the Package are described in the document, PackageVerificationCode should be computed by using the files' SHA1 checksums. Additionally, the FilesAnalyzed field in the Package MUST be set to true . * If the SHA1 checksum of any files bound by the Package is not available or the File needs to be excluded from the computation, it MUST be marked so by appending (excludes: FileName) at the end of the package verification code value. K.3.2 Examples K.3.2.1 SPDX Package and SPDX Document both contained in Archive File Examples include: tarball binding one or more files to a SPDX package, installation file which installs the package and extracts SPDX document in the same directory SPDX Field To Use: 7.9 Package verification code Guidance: * With the SPDX document included in the archive, it is not possible for the SPDX document to include a checksum for the archive itself. Generate a Package verification code and include the SPDX Document file name in the Excluded Files field. K.3.2.2 SPDX Package Delivered as an Archive File Separate from the SPDX Document Examples include: tarball, installation file SPDX Field to Use: 7.10 Package checksum Guidance: * Generate a checksum for the archive file and include it in the SPDX Package checksum field. The archive file name should also be included in the Package file name field. * If source files for the Package are included in the Package distribution archive, the Package verification code for that Package should also be included in the SPDX document and the Files analyzed field should be set to true . K.3.2.3 A Single File Represented as a SPDX Package Examples include: tarball, binary image, single executable SPDX Field To Use: 7.10 Package checksum Guidance: * If a Package download location exists, the Package checksum should be the cryptographic hash of the Package blob at the Package download location specified. * If the Package download location is not known, not available, or not accessible to the software consumer, the producer should include a Package checksum for the included Package file. K.3.2.4 Directory of Software Represented as a SPDX Package Examples include: source code, containers SPDX Field To Use: 7.9 Package verification code Guidance: * Include File name field in the SPDX document for every file in the directory, include each file\u2019s cryptographic hash as a File checksum , create a CONTAINS relationship between the Package and the files, and set Files analyzed to true on the Package. Note : if Files analyzed is set to false you cannot provide a Package verification code.","title":"How To Use SPDX in Different Scenarios"},{"location":"annexes/how-to-use/#annex-k-how-to-use-spdx-in-different-scenarios","text":"TODO: re-write for SPDXv3","title":"Annex K: How To Use SPDX in Different Scenarios"},{"location":"annexes/how-to-use/#k1-including-security-information-in-a-spdx-document","text":"SPDX 2.x has the concept of an External Reference for a Package to \"reference an external source of additional information, metadata, enumerations, asset identifiers, or downloadable content believed to be relevant to the Package.\" The specification for External Reference identifiers (Annex F) has four defined categories: - Security: CPE, SWID tag identifier, or reference to security information - Package-Manager: package identifier and locator - Persistent-id: identifier which is guaranteed to remain stable (persistent) over time - Other: Use if none of the above match your use case This section provides usage scenarios of how to leverage the Security and Persistent-id category external references specified above to refer to external security information.

For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b.

Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

Classes and Property restrictions are defined in the SimpleLicensingProfile (Classes and Properties associated with string license expressions) and in the ExpandedLicensingProfile (Classes and Properties used for a fully parsed syntax tree of license expressions). There are 2 relationship types related to licensing - declaredLicense and concludedLicense. A declaredLicense identifies the license information actually found in the Software Artifact, for example as detected by use of automated tooling. This field is not intended to capture license information obtained from an external source, such as a package's website. Such information can be included, as needed, in the concludedLicense field. A declaredLicense may be expressed differently in practice for different types of Software Artifacts. For example: for Packages: would include license info for the Package as a whole, found in the Package itself (e.g., LICENSE file, README file, metadata in the Package, etc.) would not include any license information that is not in the Package itself (e.g., license information from the project\u2019s website or from a third party repository or website) for Files: would include license info found in the File itself (e.g., license header or notice, comments indicating the license, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found in a different file (e.g., LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) for Snippets: would include license info found in the Snippet itself (e.g., license notice, comments, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found elsewhere in the File or in a different File (e.g., comment at top of File if it is not within the Snippet, LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) A declaredLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the corresponding Package, File or Snippet contains no license information whatsoever. A declaredLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a declaredLicense relationship is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a declaredLicense exists. Note that a missing declaredLicense is not the same as a relationship to NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing declaredLicense relationship. A concludedLicense is the license identified by the SPDX data creator, based on analyzing the license information in the Software Artifact and other information to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the SPDX data creator has looked and did not find any license information for this Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so).

For example: for Packages: would include license info for the Package as a whole, found in the Package itself (e.g., LICENSE file, README file, metadata in the Package, etc.) would not include any license information that is not in the Package itself (e.g., license information from the project\u2019s website or from a third party repository or website) for Files: would include license info found in the File itself (e.g., license header or notice, comments indicating the license, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found in a different file (e.g., LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) for Snippets: would include license info found in the Snippet itself (e.g., license notice, comments, SPDX-License-Identifier expression) would not include license info found elsewhere in the File or in a different File (e.g., comment at top of File if it is not within the Snippet, LICENSE file in the top directory of a repository) A declaredLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the corresponding Package, File or Snippet contains no license information whatsoever. A declaredLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a declaredLicense relationship is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a declaredLicense exists. Note that a missing declaredLicense is not the same as a relationship to NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing declaredLicense relationship. A concludedLicense is the license identified by the SPDX data creator, based on analyzing the license information in the Software Artifact and other information to arrive at a reasonably objective conclusion as to what license governs the Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoneLicense indicates that the SPDX data creator has looked and did not find any license information for this Software Artifact. A concludedLicense relationship to NoAssertionLicense indicates that one of the following applies: * the SPDX data creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective determination; * the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or * the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should be implied by doing so). If a concludedLicense is not present, no assumptions can be made about whether or not a concludedLicense exists. Note that a missing concludedLicense is not the same as a relationship to a NoAssertionLicense since the latter is a \"known unknown\" whereas no assumptions can be made from a missing concludedLicense relationship. A written explanation of a relationship to a NoAssertionLicense MAY be provided in the comment field for the relationship. If the concludedLicense for a Software Artifact is not the same as its declaredLicense, a written explanation SHOULD be provided in the concludedLicense relationship comment field.","title":"Description"},{"location":"model/Licensing/Licensing/#metadata","text":"id: https://rdf.spdx.org/v3/Licensing name: Licensing","title":"Metadata"},{"location":"model/Lite/Lite/","text":"Lite Summary The SPDX Lite profile defines a subset of the SPDX specification, from the point of view of use cases in some industries.
