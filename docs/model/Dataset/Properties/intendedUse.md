# intendedUse

## Summary

Describes what the given dataset should be used for.


## Description

IntendedUse describes what the given dataset should be used for.
Some datasets are collected to be used only for particular purposes. 
For example, medical data collected from a specific demography might only be applicable
for training machine learning models to make predictions for that demography.
In such a case, the intendedUse field would capture this information.
Similarly, if a dataset is collected for building a facial recognition model,
the intendedUse field would specify that.
