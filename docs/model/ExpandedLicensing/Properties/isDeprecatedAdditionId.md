# isDeprecatedAdditionId

## Summary

Specifies whether an additional text identifier has been marked as deprecated.


## Description

The isDeprecatedAdditionId property specifies whether an identifier for a
LicenseAddition has been marked as deprecated. If the property is not defined,
then it is presumed to be false (i.e., not deprecated).

If the LicenseAddition is included on the SPDX Exceptions List, then
the `deprecatedVersion` property indicates on which version release of the
Exceptions List it was first marked as deprecated.

"Deprecated" in this context refers to deprecating the use of the
_identifier_, not the underlying license addition. In other words, even if a
LicenseAddition's author or steward has stated that a particular
LicenseAddition generally should not be used, that would _not_ mean that the
LicenseAddition's identifier is "deprecated." Rather, a LicenseAddition
operator is typically marked as "deprecated" when it is determined that use of
another identifier is preferable.
