# additionName

## Summary

Identifies the full name of a LicenseAddition.


## Description

An additionName contains the full name of a LicenseAddition, preferably using
the title found in the applicable license addition text or file, or as
otherwise specified by the LicenseAddition's author or steward.

When no such title is specified, using a name from another well-known source or list
of licenses additions (such as OSI or Fedora) is suggested.

If no official or common name is known, any name may be used to aid in
distinguishing the LicenseAddition from other LicenseAdditions.
