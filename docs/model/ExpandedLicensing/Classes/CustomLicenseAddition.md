# CustomLicenseAddition

## Summary

A license addition that is not listed on the SPDX Exceptions List.


## Description

A CustomLicenseAddition represents an addition to a License that is not listed
on the SPDX Exceptions List at https://spdx.org/licenses/exceptions-index.html,
and is therefore defined by an SPDX data creator.

It is intended to represent additional language which is meant to be added to
a License, but which is not itself a standalone License.
