# metricDecisionThreshold

## Summary

Captures the threshold that was used for computation of a metric described in
the metric field.


## Description

Each metric might be computed based on a decision threshold.

For instance, precision or recall is typically computed by checking if the
probability of the outcome is larger than 0.5.

Each decision threshold should match with a metric field defined in the AI
package.
