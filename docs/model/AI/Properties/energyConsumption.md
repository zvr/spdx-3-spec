# energyConsumption

## Summary

Indicates the amount of energy consumption incurred by an AI model.


## Description

Captures the energy consumption of an AI model, either known or estimated.

In the absence of direct measurements, an SPDX data creator may choose to
estimate the energy consumption based on information about computational
resources (e.g., number of floating-point operations), training time, and other
relevant training details.
