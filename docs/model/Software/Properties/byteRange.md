# byteRange

## Summary

Defines the byte range in the original host file that the snippet information
applies to.


## Description

This field defines the byte range in the original host file that the snippet
information applies to.

A range of bytes is independent of various formatting concerns, and the most
accurate way of referring to the differences. The choice was made to start the
numbering of the byte range at 1 to be consistent with the W3C pointer method
vocabulary.
