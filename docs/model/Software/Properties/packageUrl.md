# packageUrl

## Summary

Provides a place for the SPDX data creator to record the package URL string
(in accordance with the
[package URL spec](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst))
for a software Package.


## Description

A packageUrl (commonly pronounced and referred to as "purl") is an attempt to
standardize package representations in order to reliably identify and locate
software packages. A purl is a URL string which represents a package in a
mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package
managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.

The purl URL string is defined by seven components:

```text
scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath
```

The definition for each component can be found in the
[purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst).
Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most
significant on the left to the least significant components on the right.

Parsing a purl string into its components works from left to right. Some extra
type-specific normalizations are required. For more information, see
[How to parse a purl string in its components](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst#how-to-parse-a-purl-string-in-its-components).
