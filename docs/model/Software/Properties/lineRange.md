# lineRange

## Summary

Defines the line range in the original host file that the snippet information applies to.


## Description

This field defines the line range in the original host file that the snippet information applies to.
If there is a disagreement between the byte range and line range, the byte range values will take precedence.
A range of lines is a convenient reference for those files where there is a known line delimiter. 
The choice was made to start the numbering of the lines at 1 to be consistent with the W3C pointer method vocabulary.
