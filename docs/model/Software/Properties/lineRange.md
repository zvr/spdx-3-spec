# lineRange

## Summary

Defines the line range in the original host file that the snippet information
applies to.


## Description

This field defines the line range in the original host file that the snippet
information applies to.

If there is a disagreement between the byte range and line range, the byte
range values will take precedence.

A range of lines is a convenient reference for those files where there is a
known line delimiter.
The choice was made to start the numbering of the lines at 1 to be consistent
with the W3C pointer method vocabulary.
