# SpdxDocument

## Summary

A collection of SPDX Elements that could potentially be serialized.


## Description

The SpdxDocument provides a convenient way to express information about collections of SPDX Elements that could potentially be serialized as complete
units (e.g., all in-scope SPDX data within a single JSON-LD file). SpdxDocument is independent of any particular serialization format or instance.
Information we wish to preserve about a specific instance of serialization of this SPDX content is NOT expressed using the SpdxDocument but rather using an associated Artifact representing a particular instance of SPDX data physical serialization.

Any instance of serialization of SPDX data MUST NOT contain more than one SpdxDocument element definition.
