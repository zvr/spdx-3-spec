# Hash

## Summary

A mathematically calculated representation of a grouping of data.


## Description

A hash is a grouping of characteristics unique to the result
of applying a mathematical algorithm
that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string (the hash)
and is a one-way function, that is,
a function which is practically infeasible to invert.

This is commonly used for integrity checking of data.

Please note that different profiles may also provide additional methods for verifying the integrity of specific subclasses of Elements.
