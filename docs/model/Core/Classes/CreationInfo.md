# CreationInfo

## Summary

Provides information about the creation of the Element.


## Description

The CreationInfo provides information about who created the Element, and when
and how it was created.

The dateTime created is often the date of last change
(e.g., a git commit date), not the date when the SPDX data was created, as
doing so supports reproducible builds.
