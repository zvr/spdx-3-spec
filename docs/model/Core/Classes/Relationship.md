# Relationship

## Summary

Describes a relationship between one or more elements.


## Description

A Relationship is a grouping of characteristics unique to an assertion
that one Element is related to one or more other Elements in some way.

To explicitly assert that no such relationships exist, the `to` property
should contain the 'NONE' individual and no other elements.

A relationship that contains 'NONE' and additional elements in the `to`
property is not valid.

To explicitly assert that no assertions are being made regarding the
existence of such relationships, the `to` property should contain the
'NOASSERTION' individual.
