# Element

## Summary

Base domain class from which all other SPDX-3.0 domain classes derive.


## Description

An Element is a representation of a fundamental concept either directly inherent
to the Bill of Materials (BOM) domain or indirectly related to the BOM domain
and necessary for contextually characterizing BOM concepts and relationships.
Within SPDX-3.0 structure this is the base class acting as a consistent,
unifying, and interoperable foundation for all explicit
and inter-relatable content objects.
