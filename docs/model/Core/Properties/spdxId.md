# spdxId

## Summary

Identifies an Element to be referenced by other Elements.


## Description

SpdxId uniquely identifies an Element which may thereby be referenced by other Elements.
These references may be internal or external.
While there may be several versions of the same Element, each one needs to be able to be referred to uniquely
so that relationships between Elements can be clearly articulated.
