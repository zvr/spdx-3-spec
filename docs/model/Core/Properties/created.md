## Summary

Identifies when the Element was originally created.


## Description

Created is a date that identifies when the Element was originally created.

The time stamp can serve as an indication as to whether the analysis needs to
be updated.

This is often the date of last change (e.g., a git commit date), not the date
when the SPDX data was created, as doing so supports reproducible builds.
