# VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship

## Summary

Links a vulnerability and one or more elements designating the latter as products
not affected by the vulnerability.


## Description

VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship connects a vulnerability and a number
of elements designating them as products not affected by the vulnerability.
This relationship corresponds to the VEX not_affected status.

**Constraints**

When linking elements using a VexNotVulnAffectedAssessmentRelationship, the
following requirements must be observed:

* Relating elements with a VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship is restricted
to the doesNotAffect relationship type.
* The from: end of the relationship must be a /Security/Vulnerability classed
element.
* Both impactStatement and justificationType properties have a cardinality of
0..1 making them optional. Nevertheless, to produce a valid VEX not_affected
statement, one of them MUST be defined. This is specified in the Minimum Elements
for VEX.

**Syntax**

```json

  "@type": "VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship",
  "@id": "urn:spdx.dev:vex-not-affected-1",
  "relationshipType": "doesNotAffect",
  "from": "urn:spdx.dev:vuln-cve-2020-28498",
  "to": ["urn:product-acme-application-1.3"],
  "assessedElement": "urn:npm-elliptic-6.5.2",
  "justificationType": "componentNotPresent",
  "impactStatement": "Not using this vulnerable part of this library.",
  "suppliedBy": ["urn:spdx.dev:agent-jane-doe"],
  "publishedTime": "2021-03-09T11:04:53Z"
