# VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship

## Summary

Links a vulnerability and one or more elements designating the latter as products
not affected by the vulnerability.


## Description

VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship connects a vulnerability and a number
of elements designating them as products not affected by the vulnerability.
This relationship corresponds to the VEX not_affected status.

**Constraints**

When linking elements using a VexNotVulnAffectedAssessmentRelationship, the
following requirements must be observed:

* Relating elements with a VexNotAffectedVulnAssessmentRelationship is restricted
to the doesNotAffect relationship type.
* The from: end of the relationship must be a /Security/Vulnerability classed
element.
* Both impactStatement and justificationType properties have a cardinality of
0..1 making them optional. Nevertheless, to produce a valid VEX not_affected
statement, one of them MUST be defined. This is specified in the Minimum Elements
for VEX.

**Syntax**

  "justificationType": "componentNotPresent",
