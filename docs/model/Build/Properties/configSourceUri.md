# configSourceUri

## Summary

Property that describes the URI of the build configuration source file.


## Description

If a build configuration exists for the toolchain or platform performing the
build, the configSourceUri of a build is the URI of that build configuration.

For example, a build triggered by a GitHub Action is defined by a build
configuration YAML file. In this case, the configSourceUri is the URL of that
YAML file.
