# environment

## Summary

Property describing the session in which a build is invoked.


## Description

environment is a map of environment variables and values that are set during a
build session.

This is different from the [parameters](parameters.md) property in that it
describes the environment variables set before a build is invoked rather than
the variables provided to the builder.
