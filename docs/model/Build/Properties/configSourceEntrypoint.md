# configSourceEntrypoint

## Summary

Property describes the invocation entrypoint of a build.


## Description

A build entrypoint is the invoked executable of a build which always runs when
the build is triggered.

is `publish`.

```yaml

on:
create:
tags: "*"

jobs:
publish:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
steps:

...
```
